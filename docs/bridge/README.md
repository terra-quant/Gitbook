  The Xhavic Bridge enables the transfer of supported digital assets between
  Ethereum and Xhavic. It provides a secure, bidirectional mechanism for moving
  assets across layers while maintaining compatib
---

# Bridge

#### Supported wallets

Xhavic Bridge supports **Ethereum-compatible wallets**, including **MetaMask**.\
The same wallet address can be used on both Ethereum and Xhavic.

***

#### Bridging direction

The bridge supports **bidirectional transfers**:

* Ethereum → Xhavic
* Xhavic → Ethereum

***

#### Transfer times

* **Ethereum → Xhavic:**\
  Transfers are typically completed within a few minutes, though timing is not guaranteed and depends on Ethereum network conditions.
* **Xhavic → Ethereum:**\
  Withdrawals require an approximately **7-day challenge period**.\
  This delay is a security feature of the OP Stack design and helps protect the network from fraudulent withdrawals.

Developers and users who require faster withdrawals may choose to use **third-party bridges**, which provide shorter finality times at their own risk.

***

#### Withdrawing assets from Xhavic

To withdraw assets from Xhavic back to Ethereum:

1. Connect an Ethereum-compatible wallet and switch to the **Xhavic network**
2. Select the asset to withdraw and submit a withdrawal transaction
3. After the withdrawal is proposed on-chain, wait for the challenge period
4. Finalize the withdrawal to receive funds on Ethereum

Withdrawal progress can be monitored in the **Transactions** section of the bridge interface.

***

#### Fees

Using the Xhavic Bridge requires paying standard **network gas fees** on:

* Ethereum
* Xhavic

Xhavic does **not charge additional protocol-level fees** for bridge usage beyond normal network costs.

***

#### Benefits of bridging to Xhavic

By bridging assets from Ethereum to Xhavic, users and developers gain access to:

* Lower transaction costs
* Faster transaction execution
* Scalable infrastructure
* dApps and protocols deployed natively on Xhavic

***

#### dApp interaction

Once assets are bridged to Xhavic, they can be used to interact with **all dApps deployed on the Xhavic network**, including DeFi protocols, NFTs, and other smart contracts.

***

#### Security considerations

While Xhavic Bridge is designed with security as a priority, all blockchain transactions involve inherent risk.\
Users and developers should:

* Verify contract addresses
* Understand bridge mechanics
* Follow standard security best practices
