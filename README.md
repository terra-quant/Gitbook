# About XHAVIC

\
Xhavic is incubated within Xhavic and plans to progressively decentralize in the years ahead through open governance, permissionless participation, and community-led upgrades. We believe that decentralization is critical to creating an open, global cryptoeconomy that is accessible, transparent, and resilient for everyone.

#### Ethereum L2

Xhavic is built as an Ethereum L2, inheriting Ethereum’s security while delivering high throughput and low latency. It provides the security, stability, and scalability required to power production-grade dApps. Developers can confidently deploy any EVM-compatible codebase and seamlessly onramp users and assets from Ethereum L1, Xhavic, and other interoperable EVM chains using standard tooling.

#### Big features, small fees

Xhavic delivers a full EVM environment at a fraction of the cost of Ethereum L1. Developers get early access to next-generation Ethereum features such as Account Abstraction (ERC-4337), gasless and sponsored transactions, smart contract wallets, and simplified developer APIs-enabling better UX without compromising security.

#### Open source

Xhavic is built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack, in collaboration with Optimism. As a Core Dev team contributing to the OP Stack, Xhavic helps ensure the stack remains a public good-open, modular, and available to everyone. All core infrastructure, tooling, and protocol upgrades are developed in the open to support long-term ecosystem growth.
