# About XHAVIC

Xhavic is a secure, low-cost, builder-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users onchain.

Xhavic is incubated within Xhavic and plans to progressively decentralize in the years ahead. We believe that decentralization is critical to creating an open, global cryptoeconomy that is accessible to everyone.
